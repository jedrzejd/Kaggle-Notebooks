## Notebooks

- [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jedrzejdudzicz/mnist-dataset-100)
    ### Description
        In this notebook, I was working on the MNIST dataset. 
        The goal was to identify handwritten numbers close to 100 percent.

    ### Versions

- [Diagnosis of pneumonia chest X-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/jedrzejdudzicz/pneumonia-detection-on-chest-x-ray-accuracy-90)

    ### Description
        I will be working with the Chest X-ray dataset (5863 JPEG) to create a universal model for pneumonia diagnosis. 
        The goal is to know with over 90% accuracy whether a person is healthy, has bacterial or viral pneumonia.

    ### Versions
    * **[Update 02.09.2020]**\
